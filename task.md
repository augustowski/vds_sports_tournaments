In the Wrangle part, you will have to

Join the two or more datasets you selected into one big data table, and
Solve issues like formatting issues, missing data, faulty values, and non-matching keys
Take notes about the steps necessary in this stage to make the data usable; you will need this for the final report.

Grading:

6 points for completing the Wrangle task.
10 points extra, if you can (visually!) show and explain the data quality of your dataset (for example, before and after cleaning steps). There are no instructions how such a visualization should look like, since this also highly depends on the chosen domain and data. You will have to come up with your own, creative, solution here.

 In the Profile stage you need to

Find at least 3 valuable insights.
Show the insights by using visualization.

The insights will have to be reported in the final report (incl. visualizations).

In the Profile part, you will have to explore the data in detail, to completely understand its structure, and to discover any interesting patterns that can be found in there. The following steps are required:

Find at least 3 informative insights in your dataset, and
Show and explain the insights using visualizations (one visualization per insight).
The insights together with the visualizations will have to be included in the report.

Grading:

8 points for the description and visual representation of every insight.
